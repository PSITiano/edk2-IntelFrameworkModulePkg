/**
   These are the notifications from the PCI bus driver that it is about to enter a certain 
   phase of the PCI enumeration process.

   This member function can be used to notify the host bridge driver to perform specific actions,
   including any chipset-specific initialization, so that the chipset is ready to enter the next phase.
   Eight notification points are defined at this time. See belows:
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginEnumeration     - Resets the host bridge PCI apertures and internal data
                                          structures. The PCI enumerator should issue this notification
                                          before starting a fresh enumeration process. Enumeration cannot
                                          be restarted after sending any other notification such as
                                          EfiPciHostBridgeBeginBusAllocation.
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginBusAllocation   - The bus allocation phase is about to begin. No specific action is
                                          required here. This notification can be used to perform any
                                          chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeEndBusAllocation     - The bus allocation and bus programming phase is complete. No
                                          specific action is required here. This notification can be used to
                                          perform any chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginResourceAllocation -  The resource allocation phase is about to begin. No specific
                                              action is required here. This notification can be used to perform
                                              any chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResources    - Allocates resources per previously submitted requests for all the PCI
                                          root bridges. These resource settings are returned on the next call to
                                          GetProposedResources(). Before calling NotifyPhase() with a Phase of
                                          EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResource, the PCI bus enumerator is responsible for gathering I/O and memory requests for
                                          all the PCI root bridges and submitting these requests using
                                          SubmitResources(). This function pads the resource amount
                                          to suit the root bridge hardware, takes care of dependencies between
                                          the PCI root bridges, and calls the Global Coherency Domain (GCD)
                                          with the allocation request. In the case of padding, the allocated range
                                          could be bigger than what was requested.
   EfiPciHostBridgeSetResources         - Programs the host bridge hardware to decode previously allocated
                                          resources (proposed resources) for all the PCI root bridges. After the
                                          hardware is programmed, reassigning resources will not be supported.
                                          The bus settings are not affected.
   EfiPciHostBridgeFreeResources        - Deallocates resources that were previously allocated for all the PCI
                                          root bridges and resets the I/O and memory apertures to their initial
                                          state. The bus settings are not affected. If the request to allocate
                                          resources fails, the PCI enumerator can use this notification to
                                          deallocate previous resources, adjust the requests, and retry
                                          allocation.
   EfiPciHostBridgeEndResourceAllocation- The resource allocation phase is completed. No specific action is
                                          required here. This notification can be used to perform any chipsetspecific
                                          programming.
      
   @param[in] PciResAlloc         The instance pointer of EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PROTOCOL
   @param[in] Phase               The phase during enumeration
   
   @retval EFI_NOT_READY          This phase cannot be entered at this time. For example, this error
                                  is valid for a Phase of EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResources if
                                  SubmitResources() has not been called for one or more
                                  PCI root bridges before this call
   @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       Programming failed due to a hardware error. This error is valid
                                  for a Phase of EfiPciHostBridgeSetResources.
   @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Invalid phase parameter
   @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   The request could not be completed due to a lack of resources.
                                  This error is valid for a Phase of EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResources if the
                                  previously submitted resource requests cannot be fulfilled or
